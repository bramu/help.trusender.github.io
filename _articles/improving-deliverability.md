                          Email delivery rates are calculated by dividing the number of emails sent minus bounces by the number of emails sent. You should remember that the number of emails sent is not the same as the number of emails delivered because when you send mailings, some emails may have bounced.

                           <b>Your email address was exposed during a data leakage.</b> This is the main reason behind spam email spreading, which happens even to the large organizations like Adobe, LinkedIn, Last.FM. It is a security threat because it may include names, passwords, and email addresses. Spammers use this data for illegal activities knowing that the majority of emails are active.
